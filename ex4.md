1. **Algorithm to Find the Room:**
   - Start at the ground floor entrance.
   - Check the sign:
      - If the lab is EY128, go to the left.
      - If the lab is not EY128, go to the right.
   - Follow the corresponding signs until you reach the room.

2. **Number of Steps to Find EY128 and Definition of a Step:**
   - It will take at most two steps to find EY128.
   - A "step" in this case is a decision point where you choose a direction based on the sign information.

3. **Best-case, Worst-case, or Neither:**
   - This is a best-case scenario because EY128 is the first room on the left, and you only need one decision point to find it.

4. **Scenarios with the Given Sign and Floor Layout:**
   - *Best-case scenario:* EY128 is the first room on the left (1 step).
   - *Worst-case scenario:* EY128 is the last room on the right (2 steps).

5. **Improving the Algorithm with Memorization:**
   - If you have memorized the floor layout, you can directly head to EY128 without checking the sign.
   - This improvement reduces the algorithm's time complexity and makes it a constant time operation, as you no longer need to follow the sign instructions. This assumes you can remember the layout reliably.
